Chapter - 72: Al-Jinn

Verse - 1: Say, [O Muhammad], "It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an.
Verse - 2: It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.
Verse - 3: And [it teaches] that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord; He has not taken a wife or a son
Verse - 4: And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression.
Verse - 5: And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie.
Verse - 6: And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden.
Verse - 7: And they had thought, as you thought, that Allah would never send anyone [as a messenger].
Verse - 8: And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames.
Verse - 9: And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.
Verse - 10: And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course.
Verse - 11: And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.
Verse - 12: And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allah upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.
Verse - 13: And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden.
Verse - 14: And among us are Muslims [in submission to Allah], and among us are the unjust. And whoever has become Muslim - those have sought out the right course.
Verse - 15: But as for the unjust, they will be, for Hell, firewood.'
Verse - 16: And [Allah revealed] that if they had remained straight on the way, We would have given them abundant provision
Verse - 17: So We might test them therein. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord He will put into arduous punishment.
Verse - 18: And [He revealed] that the masjids are for Allah, so do not invoke with Allah anyone.
Verse - 19: And that when the Servant of Allah stood up supplicating Him, they almost became about him a compacted mass."

Verse - 22: Say, "Indeed, there will never protect me from Allah anyone [if I should disobey], nor will I find in other than Him a refuge.
Verse - 23: But [I have for you] only notification from Allah, and His messages." And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, for him is the fire of Hell; they will abide therein forever.
Verse - 24: [The disbelievers continue] until, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number.
Verse - 25: Say, "I do not know if what you are promised is near or if my Lord will grant for it a [long] period."
Verse - 26: [He is] Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone
Verse - 27: Except whom He has approved of messengers, and indeed, He sends before each messenger and behind him observers
Verse - 28: That he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord; and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number.
